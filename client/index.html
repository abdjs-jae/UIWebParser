          <p>I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because,
            understand it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal
            fraction of all I want to understand about the many connections and relations
            which occur to me, how the matter in question was first thought of or arrived at,
            etc., etc.</p>
          <p>In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the succession
             of the processes is possible, and various considerations must influence the selections
             amongst them for the purposes of a calculating engine. One essential object is to choose
             that arrangement which shall tend to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing
             the calculation.</p>
          <p>Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies imagine that because the
             business of [Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine] is to give its results in numerical notation,
             the nature of its processes must consequently be arithmetical and numerical, rather than
             algebraical and analytical. This is an error. The engine can arrange and combine its numerical
             quantities exactly as if they were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it might
             bring out its results in algebraical notation, were provisions made accordingly.</p>
          <p>The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we
             know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any
             analytical revelations or truths. Its province is to assist us in making available what we are
             already acquainted with.</p>
